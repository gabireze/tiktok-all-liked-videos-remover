## Behavior details

- When you are not logged in and TikTok redirects `/profile` to `/foryou`, the panel:
  - Detects that you are not logged in.
  - Shows a clear message explaining that you must sign in and start again.
  - Marks the process as paused and disables the pause/resume button.
- When the extension cannot identify your account (no valid session data found), it shows a similar error message and stops safely.
- When removing likes:
  - Only items that match your keyword filter (if enabled) are removed.
  - The panel keeps track of pages visited, items listed, items removed, and failures.
- Failures:
  - Any failed removal is logged in the panel as a failure.
  - Failed items are included in the report with a status flag so you can review them later.
  - If too many removals fail in a row, the extension stops automatically, shows a message, and lets you download the report.

## Report format

The report exported from the panel contains all items that were processed:

- JSON: an object with two arrays
  - `removed`: items successfully removed
  - `failed`: items that could not be removed
- CSV: one table with the following columns
  - `id`
  - `authorName`
  - `desc`
  - `url`
  - `status` (`removed` or `failed`)

This makes it easy to audit what was removed and what failed, or to keep a backup list of liked videos.

## Permissions

The extension uses the following Chrome permissions:

- `host_permissions` (`https://*.tiktok.com/*`): allows the extension to run only on TikTok pages.
- `scripting`: injects and runs the content script on TikTok pages and runs the remove-like request in the page context (so it works like the site). Also reads session data needed to identify your account.
- `tabs`: opens your TikTok profile in a new tab and communicates with that tab.
- `cookies`: used only in the popup to check whether you are logged in to TikTok (by checking TikTok cookies locally).
- `storage`: saves your configuration (intervals, keywords, report format, etc.) in your browser.

No analytics, tracking, or external servers are used. All operations happen in your browser, talking directly to TikTok.

## Important notes

- The process may take time depending on how many liked videos you have.
- If TikTok temporarily blocks actions (rate limiting), wait about 1 hour and run the extension again.
- To confirm everything was removed, refresh your profile after the process completes.
