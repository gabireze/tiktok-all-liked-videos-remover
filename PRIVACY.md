## What Data We Collect

**We do not collect or transmit any personal data.**  
The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not communicate with any external server.

Specifically:

- We do **not** access any TikTok content beyond what is necessary to automate the unliking process.
- We do **not** track your activity, behavior, or browsing history.

## How the Extension Works

The extension performs the following steps:
- Opens [tiktok.com](https://www.tiktok.com) in a new browser tab.
- Navigates automatically to your TikTok profile.
- Opens your “Liked” tab.
- Enters each liked video and simulates a click to remove the like.

All actions are performed **locally in your browser**. No data is stored, transmitted, or logged externally.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** use third-party analytics, external APIs, or tracking scripts of any kind.

---

## Permissions Explanation

The extension uses the following Chrome permissions:

- **`tabs`**: Opens a new TikTok tab and allows script injection to automate the removal process.
- **`scripting`**: Enables the execution of the core logic that interacts with the TikTok page.
- **`host_permissions`** (`https://www.tiktok.com/*`): Provides access only to TikTok pages for the purpose of automation. No other domains are accessed.

These permissions are strictly required for the extension to work as intended.
